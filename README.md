# Star Pilgrims
A simple game about space exploration and building
a space station/spaceship.

# Credits
ALL CREDITS for the original version of the game
(found [here](https://raghnar.itch.io/starpilgrims)) go to
Andrea Idini from the @scienza telegram group! This is just a
native windows port in F#. All the code here is mine, but the
idea is his! Also, the code here tends to somewhat follow
what can be found in the repository for the original game, found
[here](https://github.com/AndreaIdini/StarPilgrims)
